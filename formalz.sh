# This script contains documentation and an automated step-by-step set up of the analytics server
# for FormalZ and IMPRESS. It sets up an user, gives him roles, configures access of routes,
# creates a game, gives it visualizations, enables them for teachers, configures a custom
# dashboard, and sets up everything needed for it to work with FormalZ
#
# Feel free to open an Issue in github https://github.com/e-ucm/rage-analytics, in the formalz
# branch, with any problem you find, or make a pull request with improvements.
